\section{Related Work}\label{related-work}
This section discusses relevant work such the role of USs and backlogs in agile development (Section \ref{us}) and the most frequently used pattern of USs is presented. In Section \ref{quality-framework}, the focus is on the \emph{quality user story} (QUS) framework and its tool \enquote{AQUSA} to answer the question of the existence of criteria and an automatic way to manage and identify conflicts and dependencies between user stories. Following this investigation, we draw a conclusion as to whether the existing criteria are able to optimise the USs in terms of their conflicts and dependencies.

\subsection{Role of User Stories and Backlogs in Agile Development}\label{us}
The agile software development paradigm broke the wall that classically existed between the development team and end-users. Thanks to the involvement of a \emph{product owner} (PO) who acts as a proxy to end-users for the team, the product backlog \cite{sedano2019product} became a first-class citizen during the product development. 

Furthermore, thanks to a set of user stories expressing features to be implemented in the product in order to deliver value to end-users, the development teams were empowered to think in terms of added value when planning their subsequent developments. The product is then developed iteration by iteration. 

Sedano et al. posited that a \enquote{product backlog is an informal model of the work to be done} \cite{sedano2019product}. A backlog implements a shared mental model among the practitioners working on a given product, acting as a boundary artefact between stakeholders. This model is voluntarily kept informal to support rapid prototyping and brainstorming sessions. Classically, backlogs are stored in project management systems, such as Jira\footnote{\href{https://www.atlassian.com/en/software/jira}{https://www.atlassian.com/en/software/jira}} . These tools store user stories as tickets, where stakeholders write text as natural language. Meta-data (\emph{e.g.}, architecture components, severity, quality attribute) can also be attached to the stories. However, there is no formal language to express stories or model backlogs from a state of practice point of view.

A \emph{user story} (US) is a brief, semi-structured sentence and informal description of some aspect of a software system that illustrates requirements from the user’s perspective \cite{raharjana2021user}. Large, vague stories are called epics. While user stories vary widely between organizations, most observed stories included a motivation and acceptance criteria. The brief motivation statement followed the pattern:  As a  \textless\emph{user}\textgreater\ I want to \textless\emph{action}\textgreater\ so that \textless\emph{value}\textgreater. This is sometimes called the \emph{Connextra} template. The acceptance criteria followed the pattern: Given \textless\emph{context}\textgreater, when \textless\emph{condition}\textgreater \  then \textless\emph{action}\textgreater. This is referred to as \emph{Gherkin syntax}\cite{wynne2017cucumber}. It consists of three aspects, namely aspects of \emph{who}, \emph{what} and \emph{why}. The aspect of \enquote{who} refers to the system user or actor, \enquote{what} refers to the actor’s desire, and \enquote{why} refers to the reason (optional in the user story) \cite{raharjana2021user}.

The US components consist of the following elements\cite{wautelet2017user}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item\emph{role}: abstract behaviour of actors in the system context; the aspect of who represents.
\item\emph{goal}: a state or circumstance that is desired by stakeholders or actors
\item\emph{task}: specific things that need to be done to achieve goals.
\item\emph{Capability}: the ability of actors to achieve goals based on certain conditions and events.
\end{itemize}

User stories usually have dependencies, i.e. the order in which they are implemented plays a decisive role. This raises the question of how to recognise and identify the relationships between the user stories.

\subsection{QUS Framework and AQUSA as a Tool}\label{quality-framework}
Lucassen et al. \cite{lucassen2016improving} present a quality user story (QUS) framework consisting of 13 quality criteria that US authors should strive for. The criteria analysed determine the intrinsic quality of USs in terms of \emph{syntax}, \emph{pragmatics} and \emph{semantics}. Figure~\ref{fig:qus_framework} illustrates the structure of the agile requirements verification framework. Table~\ref{tb:qus} also shows the QUS framework, which defines 13 criteria for the quality of user stories.

Based on QUS, Lucassen et al. present the automatic quality user story artisan (AQUSA) software tool for assessing and enhancing US quality automatically. Relying on NLP techniques, AQUSA detects quality defects and suggests possible remedies.

A US should follow a pre-defined, agreed template, chosen from the many templates available. In the conceptual model the skeleton of the template is called \emph{format}, which the \emph{role}, \emph{means}, and optional \emph{end(s)} are interspersed to form a US \cite{wautelet2014unifying}. 

Because USs are a controlled language, the QUS framework’s criteria are organize in \emph{Lindland’s} categories \cite{lindland1994understanding}:

\begin{itemize}
\item\emph{ Syntactic quality}, about the textual structure of a US without taking its meaning into account;
\item\emph{Semantic quality}, about the relationships and the meaning of (parts of) the US text;
\item\emph{Pragmatic quality}, takes into account not only syntax and semantics, but also the subjective interpretation of the US text by the audience.
\end{itemize}

By Lucassen et al. introduced quality criteria divided into two categories, namely \emph{Individual}, which applies to single US, and \emph{Set}, which applies to a bundle of USs. Individual criteria can be evaluated against an individual US:

\subsection*{\normalsize{well-formed}}
To be considered US, the core text of the request must contain a role and the expected functionality: the \emph{means}. Looking at the US \enquote{I want to see an error message if I can't see recommendations after uploading an article}. It is likely that the US author has forgotten to specify the role. The error can be fixed by adding the role: \enquote{As a member, I would like to see an error message if I cannot see recommendations after uploading an article}.
\subsection*{\normalsize{Atomic}}
A US should only concern one characteristic. Although it is common in practice, combining multiple USs into a larger, general US affects the accuracy of effort estimation\cite{liskin2014we}. For example, the US \enquote{As a user, I can click on a specific location on the map and thereby perform a search for landmarks associated with that combination of latitude and longitude} consists of two separate requests: Clicking on a location and viewing the associated landmarks. This US should be split into two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item  \enquote{As a user, I am able to click on a specific location on the map};
\item  \enquote{As a user, I am able to see landmarks associated with the combination of latitude and longitude of a specific location}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{\normalsize{Minimal}}
User stories should contain a role, a means and (ideally) some goals. Any additional information such as comments, descriptions of expected behaviour or notes on testing should be noted in additional notes. View the US \enquote{As a supervisor, I would like to see the registered hours for this week (split into products and activities). See: Mockup by Alice NOTE-first create the overview screen-then add validations}: In addition to a role and resources, it includes a reference to an undefined mockup and an indication of how the implementation should be approached. The requirements engineer should move both to separate US attributes such as the description or comments and keep only the basic story text: \enquote{As a care professional, I would like to see this week's registered hours}.
\subsection*{\normalsize{Conceptually sound}}
The middle and end parts of a US play a special role. The middle part should capture a specific feature, while the end part expresses the rationale for that feature. Let's look at the US \enquote{As a user, I want to open the interactive map so that I can see the location of the points of interest}: The purpose is actually a dependency on another (hidden) feature that is required for the purpose to be fulfilled, which requires the presence of a database of points of interest that is not mentioned in any of the other stories. An important additional function that is misrepresented as an end, but should be a means in a separate US, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \enquote{As a user, I would like to open the interactive map};
\item \enquote{As a user, I would like to see the location of points of interest on the interactive map}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{\normalsize{problem orientated}}
According to the principle of problem specification for requirements engineering proposed by Zave and Jackson, a US should only specify the problem. If absolutely necessary, implementation notes can be included as comments or descriptions. Apart from the violation of the minimum quality criteria, this US contains \enquote{As a care professional, I would like to save a refund - Save button top right (never greyed out)} Implementation details (a solution) within the US text. The text could be rewritten as follows \enquote{As a carer I would like to save a reimbursement}.
\subsection*{\normalsize{Unambiguous}}
Ambiguity is inherent in natural language requirements, but the requirements engineer writing USs must avoid it as much as possible. A US should not only be internally unambiguous, but should also be unambiguous in relation to all other USs. The taxonomy of ambiguity types \cite{berry2004ambiguity} provides a comprehensive overview of the types of ambiguity that can occur in a systematic requirements specification.

In this US \enquote{As a user, I am able to edit the content I have added to a person's profile page}, \enquote{content} is a superclass that refers to audio, video, and text media uploaded to the profile page, as specified in three other, separate user stories in the real US record. The requester should explicitly mention which media is editable; for example, the story can be modified as follows: \enquote{As a user, I am able to edit video, photo and audio content that I have added to a person's profile page}.
\subsection*{\normalsize{Full sentence}}
A US should read like a complete sentence, without typos or grammatical errors. The US \enquote{server configuration}, for example, is not formulated as a complete sentence (and does not correspond to the syntactic quality). By reformulating the feature as a complete sentence US, it automatically specifies what exactly needs to be configured. For example, US \enquote{Server configuration} can be converted to \enquote{As an administrator, I would like to configure the sudo-ers of the server}.
\subsection*{\normalsize{Estimatable}}
The larger and more complex the US becomes, the more difficult it is to accurately estimate the required effort. Therefore, any US should not become so large that it becomes impossible to estimate and plan with reasonable certainty\footnote{\href{http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/}{http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/}}.For example, the US \enquote{As a carer, I would like to see my route list for the next/future days so that I can prepare (e.g. I can see when I should start the journey)} a route list so that carers can prepare.

This may be an unordered list of places to visit during the working day. However, it is equally likely that the function includes an algorithmic arrangement of routes to minimise the distance travelled and/or display the route on a map. These many functionalities make an accurate estimate difficult and make it necessary to split the US into several user stories, for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \enquote{As a carer, I would like to see my route list for the next/future days so that I can prepare};
\item \enquote{As a manager, I would like to upload a route list for carers}.
\end{itemize}

The following quality criteria refer to a collection of USs. These quality criteria are relevant for assessing the quality of the entire project specification, as they focus on the entirety of the project specification and not on the individual review of each individual story:
\subsection*{\normalsize{Unique and conflict-free}}
The concept of unique USs, which emphasises the avoidance of semantic similarity or duplication within a project. For example, consider $EP_a$: \enquote{As a visitor, I can see a list of messages so I can stay up to date} and $US_a$: \enquote{As a visitor, I can see a list of messages so I can stay up to date}. This situation can be improved by offering more specific messages, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item $US_{\text{a1}}$ \enquote{As a visitor, I am able to see the latest news;}
\item $US_{\text{a2}}$ \enquote{As a visitor I am able to see sports news}
\end{itemize}
It is also important to avoid conflicts between user stories to ensure their quality. A requirements conflict occurs when two or more requirements cause an inconsistency\cite{paja2013managing} \cite{robinson1989integrating}. For example, consider the story $US_b$: \enquote{As a User, I am able to edit any landmark} contradicts the requirement that a user can edit any landmark ($US_c$: \enquote{As a User, I am able to delete only the landmarks that I added}), if we assume that edit is a general term that includes delete. $US_b$ refers to any landmark, while $US_c$ refers only to those that the user has added. One possible way to fix this is to change $US_b$: \enquote{As a user, I can edit the landmarks I have added}. \cite{lucassen2016improving}

%For example, consider the stories $US_b$:\enquote{As a user, I can edit any landmark} and $US_c$: \enquote{As a user, I can only delete the landmarks I have added}, and assuming that "editing" is a general term that includes deleting, these two user stories conflict. The conflict is between \enquote{any landmark} and \enquote{the landmark I added}.  One way to resolve this is to delete one of the user stories or explicitly exclude the deletion from $US_b$ (\emph{i.e.} \enquote{As a user, I am able to add and change any landmark})
To recognise these types of relationships, each US part must be compared with the parts of the other USs using a combination of similarity measures that are either syntactic (e.g. Levenshtein distance) or semantic (e.g. using an ontology to determine synonyms). If the similarity exceeds a certain threshold, a human analyst must analyse the USs for possible conflicts and/or duplicates.
\begin{definition}
A US $\mu$ is a 4-tuple $\mu=(r,m,E,f)$, where $r$ is the role, $m$ is the mean, $E=(e_1, e_2, . . .)$ is a set of ends and $f$ is the format. A means m is a 5-tuple $m (s,av,do,io,adj)$, where $s$ is a subject, $av$ an action verb, $do$ a direct object, $io$ an indirect object and $adj$ an adjective (io and adj can be zero, see figure \ref{fig:conceptual_model}). The set of user stories in a project is denoted by $U=(\mu_1, \mu_2, . . .)$.
\end{definition}

\includegraphics[width=10.03cm, height=7.76cm]{2.0_Conceptual_model_of_US}
\caption{Conceptual model of the user stories \cite{lucassen2016improving}}\label{fig:conceptual_model}
\end{figure}
%\begin{definition}
%\emph{Different means, same end }Two or more USs that have the same goal but achieve it by different means. This relationship potentially affects two quality criteria as it may indicate the following: (1) a feature variation that should be explicitly noted in the USs to obtain a unique set of USs, or (2) a conflict in terms of how this goal is achieved, meaning that one of the USs should be omitted to ensure conflict-free USs. Formally, for the USs $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$:\\ 
%$diffMeansSameEnd(\mu_1,\mu_2)\leftrightarrow m_1 \neq m_2 \wedge E_1 \cap E_2 \neq \emptyset$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%\emph{same means, different end} Two or more USs that achieve different ends with the same means. This relationship could affect the properties of the USs to be unique or independent of each other. If the goals are not contradictory, they can be combined into a single larger US; otherwise, they are distinct viewpoints that should be resolved. Formally speaking... 
%$sameMeansDiffEnd(\mu_1, \mu_2) \leftrightarrow m_1 = m_2 \wedge (E_1 \setminus E_2 \neq \emptyset \vee E_2 \setminus E_1 \neq \emptyset )$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%\emph{Full duplicate} $A$ US $\mu_1$ is an exact duplicate of another US $\mu_2$ if the stories are identical. This affects the uniqueness criterion. Formally speaking, \\ 
%$isFullDuplicate(\mu_1,\mu_2) \leftrightarrow \mu_1 =_{\text{syn}} \mu_2$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%\emph{Semantic duplicate} $A$ US $\mu_1$, which duplicates the query of $\mu_2$ but uses a different text; this has an effect on the uniqueness criterion. %Formal,\\ 
%$isSemDuplicate(\mu_1,\mu_2) \leftrightarrow \mu_1 = \mu_2 \wedge \mu_1 \neq _{\text{syn}} \mu_2$
%\end{definition}
\subsection*{\normalsize{uniform}}
Uniformity refers to the consistency of a US format where the majority of USs are within the same set. To assess uniformity, the Requirements Engineer determines the most common format, which is usually determined in collaboration with the team. For example, the US \enquote{As administrator, I receive an email notification when a new user is registered} is presented as a non-uniform US and can be rewritten as follows to improve uniformity: \enquote{As an administrator, I would like to receive an email notification when a new user is registered}.
\subsection*{\normalsize{Independent}}
USs should be able to be planned and implemented in any order and should not overlap conceptually. 

It is recommended that all dependencies are made explicit and visible, as complete independence is not always achievable. In addition, some interdependencies may not be possible to resolve, and you may want to consider making these interdependencies visible in a practical way, for example by adding notes to story cards or by linking to them in the issue tracker. Two examples of dependency are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item\emph{causality}: Sometimes a US ($l_1$) needs to be completed before another ($l_2$) may start. which states that $l_1$ is causally dependent on $l_2$ if certain conditions are satisfied.
\item\emph{superclasses}: USs can contain an object (\emph{e.g.}, \enquote{content} in US \enquote{As a user, I can edit the content I've added to a person's profile page}) that references several other objects in different histories. This means that the object in $l_1$ serves as a parent or superclass for the other objects.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{\normalsize{Complete}}
The implementation of a series of USs should result in a complete application. Whilst it is not necessary for the USs to cover 100\% of the application's functionality from the outset, it is important not to overlook any essential USs as this can create a significant functionality gap that hinders progress. Take for example the US \enquote{As a user, I can edit the content I have added to a person's profile page}, which requires the presence of another story describing the creation of content. This scenario can be extended to USs with action verbs that refer to non-existent direct objects, such as reading, updating or deleting an item, which requires its prior creation. To address these dependencies with respect to the direct object of the agent, Lucassen et al. introduce a conceptual relation.
\input{Section/AQUSA} 
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Independent}}
%USs should not overlap in concept and should be schedule and implementable in any order. 
%
%Complete independence may not always be achievable, the recommendation is to make any dependencies explicit and visible. Additionally, resolving certain dependencies may not be possible, and it is suggested practically approaches such as adding notes to story cards or using hyperlinks in issue trackers to make these dependencies evident. Two illustrative cases of dependencies are presented:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 	\emph{Causality}: In some cases, one US ($l_1$) must be completed before another ($l_2$) can begin. This is formalized as the predicate \enquote{$hasDep(l_1, l_2)$}, indicating that $ l_1$ causally depends on $l_2$ when specific conditions are met.
%\item 	\emph{Superclasses}: USs may involve an object (\emph{e.g.}, \enquote{Content} in US \enquote{As a User, I am able to edit the content that I added to a person’s profile page}) that refers to multiple other objects in various stories, implying that the object in $l_1$ serves as a parent or superclass for the other objects.
%\end{itemize}
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Well-formed}}
%Before it can be considered a US, the core text of the requirement needs to include a role and the expected functionality: the \emph{means}. Considering the US \enquote{I want to see an error when I cannot see recommendations after I upload an article}. It is likely that the US writer has forgotten to include the role. The story can be fixed by adding the role: \enquote{As a Member, I want to see an error when I cannot see recommendations after I upload an article.}.
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Atomic}}
%A US should concern only one feature. Although common in practice, merging multiple USs into a larger, generic one diminishes the accuracy of effort estimation\cite{liskin2014we}. For instance, the US \enquote{As a User, I am able to click a particular location from the map and thereby perform a search of landmarks associated with that latitude longitude combination} consist of two separate requirements: the act of clicking on a location and the display of associated landmarks. This US should be split into two:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $US_A$: \enquote{As a User, I’m able to click a particular location from the map};
%\item $US_B$: \enquote{as a User, I’m able to see landmarks associated with the latitude and longitude combination of a particular location}.
%\end{itemize}
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Minimal}}
%User stories should contain a role, a means, and (optimally) some ends. Any additional information such as comments, descriptions of the expected behaviour, or testing hints should be left to additional notes. Consider the US \enquote{As a care professional, I want to see the registered hours of this week (split into products and activities). See: Mockup from Alice NOTE—first create the overview screen—then add validations}: Aside from a role and means, it includes a reference to an undefined mockup and a note on how to approach the implementation. The requirements engineer should move both to separate US attributes like the description or comments, and retain only the basic text of the story: \enquote{As a care professional, I want to see the registered hours of this week.
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Conceptually sound}}
%The means and end parts of a US play a specific role. The means should capture a concrete feature, while the end expresses the rationale for that feature. Consider the US \enquote{As a User, I want to open the interactive map, so that I can see the location of landmarks}: The end is actually a dependency on another (hidden) functionality, which is required in order for the means to be realized, implying the existence of a landmark database which is not mentioned in any of the other stories. A significant additional feature that is erroneously represented as an end, but should be a means in a separate US, for example:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $US_A$: \enquote{As a User, I want to open the interactive map};
%\item $US_B$: \enquote{As a User, I want to see the location of landmarks on the interactive map.}.
%\end{itemize}
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Problem-oriented}}
%In line with the problem specification principle for requirement engineering proposed by Zave and Jackson \cite{zave1997four}, a US should specify only the problem. If absolutely necessary, implementation hints can be included as comments or descriptions. Aside from breaking the minimal quality criteria, this US \enquote{As a care professional I want to save a reimbursement—add save button on top right (never grayed out)} includes implementation details (a solution) within the US text. The story could be rewritten as follows: \enquote{As a care professional, I want to save a reimbursement.}.
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Unambiguous}}
%Ambiguity is inherent in natural language requirements, but the requirements engineer writing USs must avoid it as much as possible. Not only should a US be internally unambiguous, but it should also be clear in relationship to all other USs. The Taxonomy of Ambiguity Types \cite{berry2004ambiguity} is a comprehensive overview of the kinds of ambiguity that can be encountered in a systematic requirements specification.
%
%In this US \enquote{As a User, I am able to edit the content that I added to a person's profile page}, \enquote{content} is a superclass referring to audio, video, and textual media uploaded to the profile page as specified in three other, separate user stories in the real-world US set. The requirements engineer should explicitly mention which media are editable; for example, the story can be modified as follows: \enquote{As a User, I am able to edit video, photo and audio content that I added to a person’s profile page.}.
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Full sentence}}
%A US should read like a full sentence, without typos or grammatical errors. For instance, the US \enquote{Server configuration} is not expressed as a full sentence (in addition to not complying with syntactic quality). By reformulating the feature as a full sentence US, it will automatically specify what exactly needs to be configured. For example, US \enquote{Server configuration} can be modified to \enquote{As an Administrator, I want to configure the server’s sudo-ers.}
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Estimatable}}
%As USs grow in size and complexity, it becomes more difficult to accurately estimate the required effort. Therefore, each US should not become so large that estimating and planning it with reasonable certainty becomes impossible \footnote{\href{http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/}{http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/}}. For example, the US \enquote{As a care professional I want to see my route list for next/future days, so that I can prepare myself (for example I can see at what time I should start traveling)} requests a route list so that care professionals can prepare themselves. 
%
%While this might be just an unordered list of places to go to during a workday, it is just as likely that the feature includes ordering the routes algorithmically to minimize distance travelled and/or showing the route on a map. These many functionalities inhibit accurate estimation and call for splitting the US into multiple user stories; for example:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $US_A$: \enquote{As a Care Professional, I want to see my route list for next/future days, so that I can prepare myself};
%\item $US_B$: \enquote{As a Manager, I want to upload a route list for care professionals.}.
%\end{itemize}
%
%The subsequent quality criteria pertain to a collection of USs. These quality criteria are instrumental in the assessment of the overall project specification's quality, focusing on the entirety of the project specification as opposed to the individual scrutiny of individual stories:
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Unique and Conflict-Free}}
%The concept of unique USs, emphasizing the avoidance of semantic similarity or duplication within a project. For example considering $EP_a$: \enquote{as a Visitor, I am able to see a list of news items, so that I stay up to date} and $US_a$: \enquote{As a Visitor, I am able to see a list of news items, so that I stay up to date}. This situation can be improved by providing more specific stories, like:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $US_{\text{a1}}$ \enquote{As a Visitor, I am able to see breaking news;}
%\item $US_{\text{a2}}$ \enquote{As a Visitor, I am able to see sports news.}
%\end{itemize}
%Additionally, the importance of avoiding conflicts between user stories should be considered to ensure their quality. \textbf{\emph{A requirements conflict occurs when two or more requirements cause an inconsistency}} \cite{paja2013managing} \cite{robinson1989integrating}. For instance, considering story $US_b$: \enquote{As a User, I am able to edit any landmark} contradicts the requirement that a user can edit any landmark ($US_c$: \enquote{As a User, I am able to delete only the landmarks that I added}), if we assume that editing is a general term that includes deletion too. $US_b$ refers to any landmark, while  $US_c$ only those that user has added. A possible way to fix this is to change $US_b$ to: \enquote{As a User, I am able to edit the landmarks that I added.} \cite{lucassen2016improving}
%
%%For instance, considering the stories $US_b$:\enquote{As a User, I am able to edit any landmark} and $US_c$: \enquote{As a User, I am able to delete only the landmarks that I added} and assuming that editing is a general term that includes deletion, these two user stories are contradicting. The conflict is \enquote{any landmark} versus \enquote{the landmark that I added}.  A possible way to fix this is to delete one of the user stories or explicitly excluding the deletion from $US_b$ (\emph{i.e.} \enquote{As a User, I am able to add and modify any landmark})
%To detect these types of relationships, each US part needs to be compared with the parts of the other USs, using a combination of similarity measures that are either syntactic (\emph{e.g.}, Levenshtein’s distance) or semantic (\emph{e.g.}, employing an ontology to determine synonyms). When similarity exceeds a certain threshold, a human analyst is required to examine the USs for potential conflict and/or duplication.
%\begin{definition}
%A US $\mu$ is a 4-tuplel $\mu=(r,m,E,f)$ where $r$ is the role, $m$ is the means, $E=(e_1, e_2, . . .)$ is a set of ends, and $f$ is the format. A means m is a 5-tuple $m (s,av,do,io,adj)$ where $s$ is a subject, $av$ is an action verb, $do$ is a direct object, $io$ is an indirect object, and $adj$ is an adjective (io and adj may be null, see Figure \ref{fig:conceptual_model}). The set of user stories in a project is denoted by $U=(\mu_1, \mu_2, . . .)$.

%\begin{definition}
%\emph{Different means, same end }Two or more USs that have the same end, but achieve this using different means. This relationship potentially impacts two quality criteria, as it may indicate: (1) a feature variation that should be explicitly noted in the US to maintain an unambiguous set of USs, or (2) a conflict in how to achieve this end, meaning one of the USs should be dropped to ensure conflict-free USs. Formally, for USs $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$:\\ 
%$diffMeansSameEnd(\mu_1,\mu_2)\leftrightarrow m_1 \neq m_2 \wedge E_1 \cap E_2 \neq \emptyset$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%\emph{Same means, different end} Two or more USs that use the same means to reach different ends. This relationship could affect the qualities of USs to be unique or independent of each other. If the ends are not conflicting, they could be combined into a single larger US; otherwise, they are multiple viewpoints that should be resolved. Formally,\\ 
%$sameMeansDiffEnd(\mu_1, \mu_2) \leftrightarrow m_1 = m_2 \wedge (E_1 \setminus E_2 \neq \emptyset \vee E_2 \setminus E_1 \neq \emptyset )$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%\emph{Full duplicate} $A$ US $\mu_1$ is an exact duplicate of another US  $\mu_2$ when the stories are identical. This impacts the unique quality criterion. Formally,\\ 
%$isFullDuplicate(\mu_1,\mu_2) \leftrightarrow \mu_1 =_{\text{syn}} \mu_2$
%\end{definition}
%\begin{definition}
%\emph{Semantic duplicate} $A$ US $\mu_1$ that duplicates the request of $\mu_2$, while using a different text; this has an impact on the unique quality criterion. Formally,\\ 
%$isSemDuplicate(\mu_1,\mu_2) \leftrightarrow \mu_1 = \mu_2 \wedge \mu_1 \neq _{\text{syn}} \mu_2$
%\end{definition}
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Uniform}}
%Uniformity pertains to the consistency of a USs format, with the majority of USs within the same set. To evaluate uniformity, the requirements engineer identifies the most frequently occurring format, usually established in collaboration with the team. For example, the US \enquote{As an Administrator, I receive an email notification when a new user is registered} is presented as a non-uniform US and can be rewritten for improved uniformity as: \enquote{As an Administrator, I want to receive an email notification when a new user is registered.}
%\subsection*{\normalsize{Complete}}
%The implementation of a set of USs should result in a feature-complete application. While it's not necessary for USs to cover 100\% of the application's functionality up-front, it's crucial not to overlook essential USs, as doing so may create a significant feature gap that hinders progress. For instance, consider the US \enquote{As a User, I am able to edit the content that I added to a person’s profile page}, which requires the existence of another story describing content creation. This scenario can be extended to USs with action verbs that reference non-existent direct objects, such as reading, updating, or deleting an item, which necessitates its creation first. To address these dependencies related to the means' direct object, Lucassen et al. introduce a conceptual relationship.
