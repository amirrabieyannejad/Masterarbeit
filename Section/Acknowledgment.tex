\section*{Acknowledgment}
I want to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Gabriele Taentzer and Alexadner Lauer for their constant encouragement during the many obstacles I encountered while writing this Master's thesis. Their helpful feedback kept me on track when my work schedule suffered the most.

I also want to thank Kiarash and Saman for their endless support and love. Thank you for giving me stability and acceptance that I have never had in my life.

This thesis is dedicated to Ali Younesi, an Iranian student who has excelled academically and won medals at national and international astronomy Olympiads. He is currently a political prisoner.

Finally, I want to acknowledge Th\'{i}ch Nh\^{a}t H\d{a}nh for helping me through many long coding sessions.
