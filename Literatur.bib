  comment = {2.1. Role of User Stories & Backlogs
From a practical point of view, Sedano et al. posited that
a “product backlog is an informal model of the work to be
done” (Sedano et al. 2019), following an empirical study involv-
ing 83 practitioners over two years. A backlog implements a
shared mental model over practitioners working on a given prod-
uct, acting as a boundary artifact between stakeholders. This
model is voluntarily kept informal to support rapid prototyping
and brainstorming sessions. Classically, backlogs are stored in
project management systems, such as Jira3. These tools stores
user stories as tickets, where stakeholders write text as natural
language. Meta-data (e.g., architecture components, severity,
quality attribute) can also be attached to the stories. However,
there is no formal language to express stories or model backlogs
from a state of practice point of view.},

  abstract     = {An emerging problem in the Software Product Line Engineering ({SPLE}) is the need for integral management of planned reuse. In {SPLE} there are two instances where managing requirements gains relevance. The first one arises during the construction of {SPLs} based on legacy software or previously developed {SPLs}. The second one appears when instantiating products from the {SPLplatform}, where instantiating variability meets the custom requirements of each product. The objective of this paper is to define a framework that allows management of requirements using Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval techniques, to structure, clean, index and find reusable functionalities according to those requirements. This framework is built in a way that allows the combination of such techniques to evaluate the best combinations for finding the correct functionalities in each {SPL} domain.},
